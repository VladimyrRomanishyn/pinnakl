Task
We are grateful to you for taking this test. This is a great opportunity for you to showcase your skills to our team. Please do your very best.

1. Fetch data with countries and cities from Internet (for example here)
2. Country Multi-Select - Create a multi-select dropdown that allows users to select countries.
3. City Multi-Select - Create a second multi-select, which allows users to select cities. These are cities that are in countries picked in Country multi-select.
4. Create 4 text labels with the following calculations:
Num of selected countries / total countries in response
Num of cities available to select (in multiselect) / total cities in response.
Num of selected cities / number of available cities to select (in multiselect).
Num of selected cities / total cities in response.
Details:
Text labels should update in the real time from multi-select selection (and no buttons)
UI is not so important as code.

You are free to use any libs/packages/sandboxes etc
